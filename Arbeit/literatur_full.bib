 abstract = {Cloud computing provides new opportunities to deploy scalable application in an efficient way, allowing enterprise applications to dynamically adjust their computing resources on demand. In this paper we analyze and test the microservice architecture pattern, used during the last years by large Internet companies like Amazon, Netflix and LinkedIn to deploy large applications in the cloud as a set of small services that can be developed, tested, deployed, scaled, operated and upgraded independently, allowing these companies to gain agility, reduce complexity and scale their applications in the cloud in a more efficient way. We present a case study where an enterprise application was developed and deployed in the cloud using a monolithic approach and a microservice architecture using the Play web framework. We show the results of performance tests executed on both applications, and we describe the benefits and challenges that existing enterprises can get and face when they implement microservices in their applications.},

Unfortunately, the user is still responsible for reconciling all of the devices whenever a change is made. We present Footloose, a usercentered data store that can share data and reconcile conflicts across diverse devices. Footloose is an optimistic system based on physical eventual consistency---consistency based on the movement of devices---and selective conflict resolution---which allows conflicts to flow through devices that cannot resolve the conflict to devices the can. Using these techniques, Footloose can present consistent views of
data on the devices closest to the user without user interaction.},

 abstract = {Large Internet companies like Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn are using the microservice architecture pattern to deploy large applications in the cloud as a set of small services that can be developed, tested, deployed, scaled, operated and upgraded independently. However, aside from gaining agility, independent development, and scalability, infrastructure costs are a major concern for companies adopting this pattern. This paper presents a cost comparison of a web application developed and deployed using the same scalable scenarios with three different approaches: 1) a monolithic architecture, 2) a microservice architecture operated by the cloud customer, and 3) a microservice architecture operated by the cloud provider. Test results show that microservices can help reduce infrastructure costs in comparison to standard monolithic architectures. Moreover, the use of services specifically designed to deploy and scale microservices reduces infrastructure costs by 70{\%} or more. Lastly, we also describe the challenges we faced while implementing and deploying microservice applications.},

@proceedings{M.Almorsy.2012,
 abstract = {Multi-tenancy helps service providers to save costs, improve resource utilization, and reduce service customization and maintenance time by sharing of resources and services. On the other hand, supporting multi-tenancy adds more complexity to the shared application's required capabilities. Security is a key requirement that must be addressed when engineering new SaaS applications or when re-engineering existing applications to support multi-tenancy. Traditional security (re)engineering approaches do not fit with the multi-tenancy application model where tenants and their security requirements emerge after the system was first developed. Enabling, runtime, adaptable and tenant-oriented application security customization on single service instance is a key challenging security goal in multi-tenant application engineering. In this paper we introduce TOSSMA, a Tenant-Oriented SaaS Security Management Architecture. TOSSMA allows service providers to enable their tenants in defining, customizing and enforcing their security requirements without having to go back to application developers for maintenance or security customizations. TOSSMA supports security management for both new and existing systems. Service providers are not required to write security integration code to use a specific security platform or mechanism. In this paper, we describe details of our approach and architecture, our prototype implementation of TOSSMA, give a usage example of securing a multi-tenant SaaS, and discuss our evaluation experiments of TOSSMA.},

Individual point-to-point and synchronous communications, which tend to lead to rigid and static applications, are making way for the more loosely coupled interaction such as is supported by a publish-subscribe paradigm. In this paper, we define a taxonomy for comparing and contrasting publish subscribe systems, citing examples from the systems included in the survey. We then survey existing publish subscribe systems, and discuss their features with respect to the taxonomy. The appendix contains a code example that demonstrates use of a typical publish subscribe system.},

The processes of choosing the overall software architecture, application development and later software deployment are examined, and the most critical places (slow network, slow workstations, repetitive data entry, wrong data entered, inappropriate and complex GUI, and low IT knowledge of an end-user) are pointed out, and the general solving strategies are defined. The mentioned strategies are joined together as a general approach for maintaining a complete medical information system life-cycle. Eventually, this approach provides shorter training, efficient support during deployment, more comfortable and efficient work, and makes positive impact on adoption process. In a view of this, our main objective is to specify development and deployment guidelines that can be applied for the information systems developed in different developing countries facing similar problems.},

@book{Muhl.2006,
 abstract = {The field of event-based systems is surprisingly broad. In many scientific communities,technical talks, commercial products, and industrial projects people think about asynchronous computations and messaging, scalability and maintainability, stepwise evolution and loose coupling. Most likely, these people are discussing event-based systems, even if they use other terms. 
When we began investigating event-based systems some years ago, we were surprised to see that eventing was scattered among many disciplines of computer science. There were no workshops or conferences dedicated to this topic, for example, although many aspects of event-based systems cannot be assessed from a database, network, or software engineering perspective alone. In the same sense, commercially available products that could help solving problems of event-based architectures are often bundled and marketed in solutions of a specific domain. 
In order to channel some of the attention, the Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS) workshop series was created. It attracts people from distributed computing, database, and software engineering audiences, and it demonstrates the wide variety of facets event-based systems have. After having heard about and being engaged in interesting discussions about allegedly ``academic'' and ``real-world'' problem, in investigating many findings, and after creating many solutions in both academic and industrial environments, we decided to write this book to present both the current state-of-the-art and its base concepts. 
The book takes a distributed system's point of view. This is, of course, partly due to our own background, but more importantly we believe a solid understanding of distributed event-based systems is a good starting point for building modern computing systems. It lets you integrate sophisticated filter and data processing capabilities as well as new network topologies and routing algorithms.},

@book{Avram.2006,
 abstract = {Software is an instrument created to help us deal with the complexities of our modern life. Software is just the means to an end, and usually that end is something very practical and real. For example, we use software for air traffic control, and this is directly related to the world surrounding us. We want to fly from one place to another, and we do that using sophisticated machineries, so we create software to coordinate the flight of thousands of airplanes which happen to be in the air at any time.
Software has to be practical and useful; otherwise we would not invest so much time and resources into its creation. That makes it extremely connected to a certain aspect of our lives. A useful package of software cannot be decoupled from that sphere of reality, the domain it is supposed to help us manage. On the contrary, the software is deeply entangled with it.
Software design is an art, and like any art it cannot be taught and learned as a precise science, by means of theorems and formulas.
We can discover principles and techniques useful to be applied throughout the process of software creation, but we probably won't ever be able to provide an exact path to follow from the real world need to the code module meant to serve that need. Like a picture or a building, a software product will include the personal touch of those who designed and developed it, something of the  charisma and flair (or the lack of it) of those who contributed to its inception and growth. There are different ways to approach software design. For the last 20 years, the software industry has known and used several methods to create its products, each with its advantages and shortcomings. The purpose of this book is to focus on a design method which has emerged and evolved over the last two decades, but has crystallized more clearly during the last few years: domain-driven design. Eric Evans has made a great
contribution to this subject matter by writing down in one book much of the accumulated knowledge about domain-driven
design. For a more detailed presentation of this topic, we recommend reading his book ``Domain-Driven Design: Tackling
Complexity in the Heart of Software'', published by Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 0-321-12521-5.},

@book{Evans.2004,
 abstract = {The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process.
Domain-Driven Design fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development.
Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis--refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code--in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:
Getting all team members to speak the same language
Connecting model and implementation more deeply
Sharpening key distinctions in a model
Managing the lifecycle of a domain object
Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways
Making complex code obvious and predictable
Formulating a domain vision statement
Distilling the core of a complex domain
Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model
Applying analysis patterns
Relating design patterns to the model
Maintaining model integrity in a large system
Dealing with coexisting models on the same project
Organizing systems with large-scale structures
Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs
With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.},

At one end of the spectrum, the use of document store NoSQL systems (e.g. MongoDB) threatens to move modern Web 2.0 applications away from traditional RDBMSs. At the other end of the spectrum, big data DSS analytics that used to be the domain of parallel RDBMSs is now under attack by another class of NoSQL data analytics systems, such as Hive on Hadoop. So, are the traditional RDBMSs, aka ``big elephants'', doomed as they are challenged from both ends of this ``big data'' spectrum? In this paper, we compare one representative NoSQL system from each end of this spectrum with SQL Server, and analyze the performance and scalability aspects of each of these approaches
(NoSQL vs. SQL) on two workloads (decision support analysis and interactive data-serving) that represent the two ends of the application spectrum. We present insights from this evaluation and speculate on potential trends for the future.},

The authors also include examples covering a variety of different integration technologies, such as JMS, MSMQ, TIBCO ActiveEnterprise, Microsoft BizTalk, SOAP, and XSL. A case study describing a bond trading system illustrates the patterns in practice, and the book offers a look at emerging standards, as well as insights into what the future of enterprise integration might hold. This book provides a consistent vocabulary and visual notation framework to describe large-scale integration solutions across many technologies. It also explores in detail the advantages and limitations of asynchronous messaging architectures. The authors present practical advice on designing code that connects an application to a messaging system, and provide extensive information to help you determine when to send a message, how to route it to the proper destination, and how to monitor the health of a messaging system.If you want to know how to manage, monitor, and maintain a messaging system once it is in use, get this book.},

Traditionally, most of these organizations have stored structured data in relational databases for subsequent access and analysis. However, a growing number of developers and users have begun turning to various types of nonrelational, now frequently called NoSQL-databases. Nonrelational databases, including hierarchical, graph, and object-oriented databases-have been around since the late 1960s. However, new types of NoSQL databases are being developed. And only now are they beginning to gain market traction. Different NoSQL databases take different approaches. What they have in common is that they're not relational. Their primary advantage is that, unlike relational databases, they handle unstructured data such as word-processing files, e-mail, multimedia, and social media efficiently. This paper discuss issues such as limitations, advantages, concerns and doubts regarding NoSQL databases.},

 abstract = {Web applications have grown in popularity over the past decade. Whether you are building an application for end users or application developers (i.e., services), your hope is most likely that your application will find broad adoption and with broad adoption will come transactional growth. If your application relies upon persistence, then data storage will probably become your bottleneck. There are two strategies for scaling any application. The first, and by far the easiest, is vertical scaling: moving the application to larger computers. Vertical scaling works reasonably well for data but has several limitations. The most obvious limitation is outgrowing the capacity of the largest system available. Vertical scaling is also expensive, as adding transactional capacity usually requires purchasing the next larger system. Vertical scaling often creates vendor lock, further adding to costs.
Horizontal scaling offers more flexibility but is also considerably more complex. Horizontal data scaling can be performed along two vectors. Functional scaling involves grouping data by function and spreading functional groups across databases. Splitting data within functional areas across multiple databases, or sharding, adds the second dimension to horizontal scaling.},

 abstract = {Today, when businesses and organizations are generating huge volumes of data; the applications like Web 2.0 or social networking requires processing of petabytes of data. Stock Exchange Systems are among the ones that process large amount of quotes and trades on a daily basis. The limited database storage ability is a major bottleneck in meeting up the challenge of providing efficient access to information. 
Further to this, varying data are the major source of information for the financial industry. This data needs to be read and written efficiently in the database; this is quite costly when it comes to traditional Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is good for different scenarios and can handle certain types of data very well, but it isn't always the perfect choice. The existence of innovative architectures allows the storage of large data in an efficient manner. 
``Not only SQL'' brings an effective solution through the provision of an efficient information storage capability. NOSQL is an umbrella term for various new data store. The NOSQL databases have gained popularity due to different factors that include their open source nature, existence of non-relational data store, high-performance, fault-tolerance, and scalability to name a few. Nowadays, NOSQL databases are rapidly gaining popularity because of the advantages that they offer compared to RDBMS.
The major aim of this research is to find an efficient solution for storing and processing the huge volume of data for certain variants. The study is based on choosing a reliable, distributed, and efficient NOSQL database at Cinnober Financial Technology AB. The research majorly explores NOSQL databases and discusses issues with RDBMS; eventually selecting a database, which is best suited for financial data management. It is an attempt to contribute the current research in the field of NOSQL databases which compares one such NOSQL database Apache Cassandra with Apache Lucene and the traditional relational database MySQL for financial management.
The main focus is to find out which database is the preferred choice for different variants. In this regard, the performance test framework for a selected set of candidates has also been taken into consideration.},

@article{Rajkovic.2013,
 abstract = {During exploitation of a medical information system dedicated to primary care facilities, we realized that significant amount of often used, but rarely changed data is scattered in large number of data tables requiring many join operations when need to be retrieved. Additionally, in many cases, many data fields are retrieved by select queries and later neither displayed on user interface, nor used in any other way. This situation could be a cause for some performance issues as well as unnecessary increase of data traffic. For this reason we decided to improve our system by applying command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) pattern with de-normalized read database in order to reduce time and data amount needed for some often executed queries. In read database design process we applied model driven approach and used our existing data modeling, mapping and code generating tools. Also, we developed a synchronization component responsible for migrating data from main to read database based on the existing data replicator. In this paper we present the results on applying this approach mainly on demographic, administrative and partly on medical data. In the near future we plan to extend this approach in our medical information system as much as possible.},

@misc{Rozendaal.13.13.2011,
 abstract = {Currently many business applications are developed using a very database centric approach, often requiring the use of complex and heavy-weight Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to make developers productive. Although improvements have been made (through the use of annotations, reflections, conventions) the core issues remain:
Lack of modularity
High coupling to the used ORM and/or underlying database, making it unnecessarily hard to use alternative (NoSQL) or multiple databases
Hard to understand the full application, due to the complexity of the used ORM
Mutability is in-grained, reducing the possibilities for composition and modularity
Limited possibility for abstraction, due to limitations imposed by the ORM on used data types, etc.
In this talk we'll explore the use of an alternative approach using the techniques pioneered by Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and especially Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): Event Sourcing.
Using Event Sourcing the application can be split into two parts:
Domain logic responsible for generating events (command side)
Reporting, view, integration, etc. logic that consumes the generated events ({\dq}query{\dq} side).
Through this explicit notion of change (domain events) the developer is put back in control of the application.
Traditional languages such as Java require a lot of ceremony when implementing event sourcing, obscuring the basic simplicity. Using Scala's flexible syntax and support for light-weight classes, immutable data structures and transactional memory only very little support code is needed to build production ready applications using Event Sourcing. We can start simple and scale up to more complexity only when needed. During this talk we'll take a quick tour through the code you might need to get started.
The goals are to make developers productive while keeping applications understandable and maintainable. This is achieved by:
Putting the developer back into control, instead of a framework
Keeping infrastructure concerns out of your domain code
Manage complexity in a scalable manner. Simple functionality ({\dq}CRUD{\dq}) is easy to implement, while allowing a clear path towards complex behavior and implementation
A simple cost model: the cost of generating, storing, and processing events is clear, as is the cost for querying derived data. With relational databases and ORMs costs are much less clear and often highly dependent on external factors such as configuration, table statistics, etc.
Simple, clearly delineated application components that interact through well-defined interfaces, for both infrastructure and domain code
Mostly immutable data structures with mutation controlled by using Scala's software transactional memory
Some of these concepts were first explored in a series of blog posts and was presentated at ScalaDays in 2011 at Standford University in California.},

@phdthesis{Stander.2011,
 abstract = {Datenbanken werden im Computeralltag mittlerweile fl{\"a}chendeckend eingesetzt, u.a. bei:
Desktopapplikationen
Webapplikationen
Enterprisenanwendungen / Gesch{\"a}ftsbetrieb
Privatnutzer
So ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, dass sich mit der gestiegenen Anzahl von Einsatzfeldern auch die Nachfrage zu neuen, flexibleren Datenbanksystemen ge{\"a}ndert hat. Die NoSQL-Bewegung ist - grob zusammengefasst - eine von diesen. Der Name NoSQL steht f{\"u}r not-only-SQL und bedeutet in der Regel, dass neue Ans{\"a}tze bezogen auf die API, Datenverwaltung, Verf{\"u}gbarkeit, Skalierbarkeit und Geschwindigkeit der Datenbanksysteme verfolgt werden. In der Bachelorarbeit m{\"o}chte ich ein herk{\"o}mmliches relationales Datenbanksystem (MySQL) mit einem neunen, nicht-relationalen Datenbanksystem (MongoDB) vergleichen. Beide Datenbanken sind {\"u}ber Open-Source-Lizenzen verf{\"u}gbar, haben eine gro{\ss}e Nutzerzahl (vor allem im Webapplikationsbereich), werden jeweils von einer Firma betreut/vermarktet und werden aktiv weiterentwickelt. Damit soll sichergestellt sein, dass wir hier zwei zeitgem{\"a}{\ss}e Datenbanksysteme vergleichen.
Als Datenmaterial wird die Wikipedia verwendet, da sie zum einen strukturell f{\"u}r eine NoSQLDatenbank pr{\"a}destiniert ist und bis heute offiziell auf einem relationalen Datenbanksystem (MySQL) betrieben wird. Zudem liegen die Datenmengen mit {\"u}ber 2 Millionen Eintr{\"a}gen (entsprechend 7GB an Datenvolumen) in einer {\glqq}businesstauglichen{\grqq} Gr{\"o}{\ss}enordnung und sind freiverf{\"u}gbar.Als non-relationale Datenbank kommt die MongoDB zum Einsatz. Sie ist eine dokumentenbasierte Datenbank mit Eigenschaften einer herk{\"o}mmlichen relationalen Datenbank und deshalb ein ad{\"a}quates Gegenst{\"u}ck zu MySQL. Andere popul{\"a}re NoSQL-Vertreter, wie z.B. CouchDB, sind in ihren Ans{\"a}tzen und Unterschieden wesentlich radikaler. So besitzt die MongoDB ebenfalls Hauptschl{\"u}ssel, Feldindexierung und bietet auch die M{\"o}glichkeit Datens{\"a}tze direkt miteinander verkn{\"u}pfen.
Beim Importvorgang wird f{\"u}r beide Datenbanksysteme jeweils eine angepasste Struktur gew{\"a}hlt, um den abschlie{\ss}enden Geschwindigkeitsvergleich so fair wie m{\"o}glich zu gestalten. Das Ergebnis der Arbeit soll ein {\"u}bersichtlicher Vergleich beider Datenbanksysteme sein. Dabei geht es nicht um das theoretische Aufz{\"a}hlen von Vor- und Nachteilen der jeweiligen Datenbank, sondern um einen praxisnahen Anwendungsfall, der von beiden Datenbanken bew{\"a}ltigt werden muss. Zudem soll gezeigt werden, dass es durchaus Sinn macht, f{\"u}r bestimmte Anwendungszwecke spezielle Datenbanksysteme zu verwenden.},

@article{Tjondronegoro.2008,
 abstract = {Sport video data is growing rapidly as a result of the maturing digital technologies that support digital video capture, faster data processing, and large storage. However, (1) semi-automatic content extraction and annotation, (2) scalable indexing model, and (3) effective retrieval and browsing, still pose the most challenging problems for maximizing the usage of large video databases. This article will present the findings from a comprehensive work that proposes a scalable and extensible sports video retrieval system with two major contributions in the area of sports video indexing and retrieval. The first contribution is a new sports video indexing model that utilizes semi-schema-based indexing scheme on top of an Object-Relationship approach. This indexing model is scalable and extensible as it enables gradual index construction which is supported by ongoing development of future content extraction algorithms. The second contribution is a set of novel queries which are based on XQuery to generate dynamic and user-oriented summaries and event structures. The proposed sports video retrieval system has been fully implemented and populated with soccer, tennis, swimming, and diving video. The system has been evaluated against 20 users to demonstrate and confirm its feasibility and benefits. The experimental sports genres were specifically selected to represent the four main
categories of sports domain: period-, set-point-, time (race)-, and performance- based sports. Thus, the proposed system should be generic and robust for all types of sports.},

@misc{vanHoof.2006,
 abstract = {Many people think of SOA as synchronous RPC (mostly over Web services). Others say EDA is SOA. And there are people who say that the best of EDA and SOA is combined in SOA 2.0. But an architectural distinction can be made between a request- and-reply pattern and a publish-and-subscribe pattern. Both patterns are an inverse of each other. Because of the completely different nature and use of the two patterns, it is necessary to be able to distinguish between the both and to name them. You might say making such a distinction is a universal architectural principle. Combining both of the patterns into an increment of the version number of one of them is not a very clever act. It is appropriate and desirable to use the acronyms SOA and EDA to make this distinction, because SOA and EDA are both positioned in the same architectural domain; SOA focusing on (the decomposition of) business functions and EDA focusing on business events. This article explains the differences between the two patterns, when to use the one or the other and how to combine them.},
